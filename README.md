# 🚀 aereo Plugin Template

Welcome to the **aereo plugin template**! This repository is your starting point for building high-performance, modular plugins for the `aereo` ecosystem. 

Powered by the [Polylith architecture](https://davidvujic.github.io/python-polylith-docs/setup/) and `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management, this template ensures your plugin is scalable, maintainable, and ready for production.

## ⚡ Quick Start

If you are new here, **start with the setup script**. It will bootstrap your environment, name your project, and create your first component automatically.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` script automates the tedious parts of starting a new Polylith plugin:
1.  **Validation**: Ensures your project name follows the `aereo-` prefix rule.
2.  **Environment**: Installs `uv` (if missing) and sets up the workspace dependencies.
3.  **Scaffolding**: Creates your first **Component** (for code) and **Project** (for packaging).
4.  **Configuration**: Generates a pre-configured `pyproject.toml` with standard entry points so `aereo` can immediately find your plugin.
5.  **Git Hooks**: Installs `prek` to ensure high-quality commits from day one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The setup script is mandatory for new project initialization. It ensures consistent naming conventions (`aereo-` prefix) and registers your plugin entry points correctly.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project uses a **Polylith** structure. Instead of a messy monolith, code is organized into:

*   **Components**: Pure logic and functionality (found in `components/`).
*   **Projects**: Deployable artifacts like PyPI packages (found in `projects/`).
*   **Bases**: Public APIs or entry points (CLI, FastAPI, etc.).

### Why Polylith?
It allows you to share code between different projects within the same workspace perfectly, while keeping your deployments lean.

## 📖 Reference Plugins

If you want to see how production-ready plugins look in the wild, use these implementations as guides:
- **Search Plugin Example**: [aereo-search-aws-goes](https://github.com/frandorr/aereo-search-aws-goes)
- **Extraction Plugin Example**: [aereo-extract-aws-goes](https://github.com/frandorr/aereo-extract-aws-goes)

## 🛠️ Development Workflow: Step-by-Step

Once you've run the setup script, here is a step-by-step guide to building your new plugin:

### 1. Identify Your Scaffolding
The `setup.sh` wizard automatically creates the initial file structure in `components/aereo/your_component/`. Inside, you will find a `core.py` that inherits from the correct base class:
- `SearchProvider` for projects starting with `aereo-search-`.
- `Extractor` for projects starting with `aereo-extract-`.

### 2. Implement Plugin Logic
Open `components/aereo/your_component/core.py`.
- **For Search Providers**: Override the `search()` method to return a GeoDataFrame matching the `AssetSchema`.
- **For Extractors**: Override `prepare_for_extraction()`, `extract()`, and potentially `extract_batches()` to handle processing workflows and return an `ArtifactSchema` GeoDataFrame.
  - `prepare_for_extraction()` receives a `GridConfig` object — read tiling parameters (cell size, margin, overlap) from it rather than hard-coding defaults.
  - Domain config lives on `profile.extract_params`; the old `prepare_params` catch-all has been removed.
*(Hint: Peek into the [Reference Plugins](#reference-plugins) to see exact implementations!)*

### 3. Check Workspace Info
See the state of your workspace, which components are used by which projects:
```bash
uv run poly info
```

### 4. Adding Dependencies
Use `uv` to manage your environment. For example:
```bash
uv add requests          # Add to the workspace
uv add --group dev pytest  # Add development tools
```

### 5. Running Tests
Tests are enabled globally. Write your tests inside `components/aereo/your_component/test/` and run them with:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

---

## 📦 Creating More Components (Advanced)

If your plugin grows and you need to split logic into more components, you can use the Polylith CLI:

```bash
# Create a new component
uv run poly create component --name my_new_feature

# Create a new project (if you want to ship a separate package)
uv run poly create project --name aereo-my-other-package
```

---

## 🚀 Releasing Plugins

Releases are automated using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and `python-semantic-release`.

1.  **Commit with prefixes**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` in your commit messages.
2.  **Run the release script**:
    ```bash
    # Release a specific project
    python3 .agents/scripts/release.py aereo-my-plugin

    # Release all changed projects
    python3 .agents/scripts/release.py --changed
    ```

### 🤖 Agentic Workflow
If you are working with **Antigravity** or another AI assistant, you can simply say:
> "Release my plugin" or "Create a new release for aereo-search-earthaccess"

The assistant will use the `new-release` skill to handle the versioning, tagging, and pushing for you.
